What is Recursion?
Recursion is a technique in which a function calls itself in order to solve smaller instances of the same problem. It breaks down complex problems into simpler sub-problems until it reaches a base case.

Key Concepts of Recursion:
    Base Case: The condition where the recursion stops. Without a base case, the recursion would continue indefinitely, leading to a stack overflow error.
    Recursive Case: The part of the function where the function calls itself with a smaller or simpler problem.



    Recursive vs Iterative Approaches
Many problems can be solved either using recursion or using loops (iteration). Letâ€™s compare the two approaches:

Recursion:
Pros:
Elegant and easier to understand when the problem is naturally recursive (like trees, graphs, etc.).
Useful when breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems is a good strategy.
Cons:
Can lead to excessive function calls, which increase memory usage (stack space).
Not always efficient (e.g., Fibonacci without memoization has an exponential time complexity).
Iteration:
Pros:

More space-efficient (no function call overhead).
Better performance in some cases (like the Fibonacci sequence).
Cons:

May require more complex logic to handle problems that are easier to express with recursion.
